# plain exit-42 on job-1,step-1 and success()||failure() on job-1,step-2 means
#   job-1,step-2 runs? YES
#   job-2 runs? NO

# plain exit-42 on job-1,step-1 and NO success()||failure() on job-1,step-2 means
#   job-1,step-2 runs? NO
#   job-2 runs? NO

# With this...
#      - name: step-1 from job-1
#        run: |
#          echo Hello from job-1, step-1
#          sdf
#          echo Hello from job-1, step-1, after an error
#          exit 42
# then
# the second echo is NOT run, and the exit code of the job is 127 (not 42)

# With this...
#  job-2:
#    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#    needs: [ job-1 ]
#    if: ${{ success() || failure() }}
# then
# job1 failed, job2 waits for job1 to finish, and does then run.

# Putting continue-on-error: true
# at the step level, means that if the step fails
# the other steps still run, and the job succeeds
# Eg, there is no "Rerun failed jobs" option in the CI.

# Putting continue-on-error: true
# at the job-2 level, seems to have no effect.
# job1 fails, but job2 is not run (it is skipped)

# Putting continue-on-error: true
# at the job-1 level, means that job1 steps 2,3 are not run.
# and job-1 fails, and job-2 is run.
